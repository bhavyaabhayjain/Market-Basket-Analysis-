Apriori Algorithm and Brute force method Compared

Using each of the five newly formed transaction databases, implement the brute force approach and evaluate its performance against the Apriori algorithm. Present the computation (CPU or clock) time as well to show that, for each of the 5 transaction databases, the Apriori algorithm is quicker than the brute-force approach.
